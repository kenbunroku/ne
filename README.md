This is a coding practice of React + Typescript. I coded a clone of Netflix website.\
This is Japanese [Tutorials](https://zenn.dev/gunners6518/books/4c4672f32dd100) I followed. You can see [an English video](https://youtu.be/XtMThy8QKqU) on YouTube.\

This has following functions.\
- Retrieve and display NetflixApi from TMDB
- Display in columns by genre
- The background of the banner changes depending on the slide.
- When you click on a movie, if there is one, it will show the promotional Youtube video in an iFrame.

ï¼ƒ Demo
The app is deployed using Firebase at https://react-typscript-netflix-clone.web.app/.
